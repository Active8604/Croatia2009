Hi, my name is Andrew. I like soccer and my favorite player is Cristiano Ronaldo. I used to play for Albion soccer but then I drifted to waterpolo. I play waterpolo at Del Norte and i play for Poway valley waterpolo club. My favorite place to eat is Dave's Hot Chicken and I also love street tacos. I value friends and family above most things. I also enjoy watching old basketball clips of Michael Jordan. I also enjoy fingerboarding and i have been at a fingerboarding competition.
