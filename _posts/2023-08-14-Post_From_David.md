### Andrew and making posts on my partner's repository

Making posts on Andrew's repository was a challenge because he was behind and unable to commit the changes. This frustrated me, as Andrew was not putting much effort into this class, and was mostly just copying me, talking to friends, and playing games. Also, it forced me to waste 20 minutes just play some Brawl Stars while I waited for him to fix this problem. Granted, I could have helped him or done something else, but I wanted to finish posting on my partner's repository before starting the confusing snake game. When we started together, he had not even set up the tools, which was supposed to be done last week. He also didn't give me enough personal space. In the end, he is still my partner and he might still help me in the future coding a game and doing things like that.
