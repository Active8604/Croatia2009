### PBL Unit 1 / Week 2

Since we haven't done coding yet, I will be talking about Fortnite. Fortnite has become very bad. One reason Fortnite has become bad is because the old season returned and so everyone was was hyped and everyone was playing. But a few days ago, they took the old season away and replaced it with a new season, Chapter 5 season , which almost everyone thinks is bad. the only good/funny thing about the new season is that Peter Griffin is a boss. Since the new season returned, I will no longer be playing. Epic which is the creator of Fortnite has changed Fortnite for the worse and not the better.
